## Edit 1

Add a test mode that will allow me to view different states of the blob. Base the test mode off of a config setting. When test mode is on, the following controls should be viewable on the page:

1. A slider for viewing the blob at any UTC time, from 0 to 24.
2. A "Generate new blob" button for similating a "new" day.
